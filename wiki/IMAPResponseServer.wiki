#summary IMAP Response Server

= Introduction =

The IMAP Response Server is based on the gen_server behavior and it handles all of the responses for all commands that are processed by the IMAP server. The response server accepts events from the SMTP server, other IMAP clients or other events that happen on the server and queue responses for each client into their own message queue.

This allows for a client to receive messages about a mailbox that the client has selected that may have been generated by another process. Most notably when new messages arrive from the SMTP server or another IMAP client changes information about a message.
